## Background

[Core Dumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump) are a critical part of observability.

As systems become more distributed core dumps offer teams a non-invasive approach to understanding why programs are malfunctioning in any environment they are deployed to.

Core Dumps are useful in a wide number of scenarios but they are very relevant in the following cases:

- The process exits without a useful stack trace

- The process runs out of memory

- An application doesnâ€™t behave as expected

The traditional problems with core dumps are: 

- Overhead of managing the dumps

- Dump Analysis required specific tooling that wasn't readily available on the developers machine.

- Managing Access to the dumps as they can contain sensitive information.

This chart aims to tackle the problems surrounding core dumps by leveraging common platforms (K8s, ROKS and Object Storage) in a cloud environment to pick up the heavy lifting.

## Chart Details

The chart deploys two processes:

1. The **agent** manages the updating of `/proc/sys/kernel/*` configuration, deploys the composer service and uploads the core dumps zipfile created by the composer to an object storage instance.

2. The **composer** handles the processing of a core dump and creating runtime, container coredump and image JSON documents from CRICTL and inserting them into a single zip file. The zip file is stored on the local file system of the node for the agent to upload.


When you install the IBM Cloud Core Dump Handler Helm chart, the following Kubernetes resources are deployed into your Kubernetes cluster:

- **Namespace**: A specific namespace is created to install the components into - defaults to ibm-observe

- **Handler Daemonset**: The daemonset deploys a [pod](./charts/core-dump-handler/templates/daemonset.yaml) on every worker node in your cluster. The daemonset contains configuration to enable the elevated process to define the core pattern  to place the core dump into object storage as well as gather pod information if available.

- **Privileged Policy**: The daemonset configures the host node so priviledges are required.

- **Service Account**: Standard Service account to run the daemonset

- **Volume Claims**: For copying the composer to the host and enabling access to the generated core dumps

- **Cluster Role**: Created with an **event** resource and **create** verb and associated with the service account. 

## Component Diagram
### Service Component Layout
![Component Diagram](assets/topology.png)

### Permissions
To install the Helm chart in your cluster, you must have the **Administrator** platform role.

## Security implications
This chart deploys privileged kubernetes daemonset with the following implications: 

1. the automatic creation of privileged container per kubernetes node capable of reading core files querying the crictl for pod info. 

2. The daemonset uses hostpath feature interacting with the underlying Linux OS.

3. The composer binary is deployed and ran on the host server

4. Core dumps can contain sensitive runtime data and the storage bucket access must be managed accordingly.

5. Object storage keys are stored as secrets and used as environment variables in the daemonset

## Resources Required
The IBM Cloud Core Dump Handler requires the following resources on each worker node to run successfully:
- CPU: 0.2 vCPU
- Memory: 128MB

## Updating the Chart

1. Delete the chart. Don't worry this won't impact the data stored in object storage.
```
$ helm delete core-dump-handler --namespace observe
```
2. Ensure the persitent volume for`host-name` are deleted before continuing
```
$ kubectl get pvc -n observe
```
3. Install the chart using the same bucket name as per the first install but tell the chart not to creat it. 
```
$ helm install core-dump-handler . --namespace observe 
```

## Removing the Chart

```
helm delete core-dump-handler -n observe
```

## Build and Deploy a Custom Version

The services are written in Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

1. Build the image `docker build -t YOUR_TAG_NAME .`

2. Push the image to your container registry

3. Update the container in the `values.yaml` file to use it.

```yaml
image:
  registry: YOUR_REGISTRY
  repository: YOUR_REPOSITORY
  tag: YOUR_TAG
```
or run the helm install command with the settings
```
--set image.registry=YOUR_REGISTRY \
--set image.repository=YOUR_REPOSITORY \
--set image.tag=YOUR_TAG
```
## Testing

1. Login to your kubernetes cluster so that `kubectl` can be ran from the script.

1. Ensure you have an minio client in your PATH on your machine.

    ```
    which mc
    /usr/local/bin
    ```
1. If you don't have an minio client it can be installed on linux with

    ```
    wget https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc
    chmod +x mc
    sudo cp mc /usr/local/bin/mc
    ```
    Other OSes are detailed here https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html

1. Publish the container definition for this project to a registry

   ```
   docker build -t REPOSITORYNAME:YOUR_TAG .
   docker push REPOSITORYNAME:YOUR_TAG
   ```

1. Modify the image definition in the yaml

    ```yaml
    image:
    repository: REPOSITORYNAME:YOUR_TAG
    ```
1. In the root of the project folder create a file called `.env` with the following configuration

    ```
    S3_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX
    S3_SECRET=XXXX
    S3_BUCKET_NAME=XXXX
    S3_REGION=XXXX
    ```

1. Change directory to the integration folder and run the test

    ```
    cd integration
    ./run.sh
    ```


## Troubleshooting

The first place to look for issues is in the agent console.
A successful install should look like this

```

```

If the agent is running successfully then there may be a problem with the composer configuration.
To check the logs for the composer open a shell into the agent and cat the composer.log to see if there are any error messages.

```
cat /var/mnt/core-dump-handler/composer.log
```

If there are no errors then you should change the default log from `error` to `debug` in the values.yaml and redeploy the chart.
Create a core dump again and `/var/mnt/core-dump-handler/composer.log` should contain specific detail on each upload.
